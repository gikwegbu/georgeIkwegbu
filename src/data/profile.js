    bio: "I'm a mobile engineer with 5+ years of experience building production-grade Flutter applications across fintech, mobility, and IoT. My journey in tech started in web development, where I honed my fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript — before discovering the power of cross-platform mobile development with Flutter and Dart.\n\nSince making the switch, I've led teams, shipped apps to the Play Store and App Store, reduced deployment times by 40%, and cut memory crashes by 98%. I'm currently completing my MSc in Computer Science at York St. John University, with a focus on AI, IoT, and Machine Learning.\n\nBased in London, I'm passionate about creating seamless hardware-software experiences and mentoring the next generation of developers.",
